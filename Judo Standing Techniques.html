<h1>Judo Standing techniques (Throws)</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>This section presents the "real" techniques while you fight standing. Standing techniques are called "Tachi-waza". Judo is fought most of the time standing, and Judokas will always win competitions by using these standing techniques. It is important to note that there are a lot of standing techniques, and that it is better to learn each one of them in person.</p>
<p>Finally, each individual have their own form of Judo. For example: I use a specific conbination like Sasai, which is a pull, and Ippon Seoi-Nage. As you progress thru this martial-art, you'll find a nest that will be the base of your own art in Judo.</p>

<h2>Uchi-Mata</h2>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<p>
Uchi-Mata is a classic technique used in a specific timing. It is really useful when an opponent if moving towards you, or to the sides. 
	</p>
	<br>
<p>
	The key of Uchi-Mata is always the 6 fundamentals of Judo. If you lack either positioning, footwork or the Kuzushi, your Uchi-Mata might not work. I will explain the positioning in right-handed terms, because the left-handed is the same thing but in opposite. 
</p>
<br>
<p>At first, make sure to have a good grip: The lapel on your right hand, and the sleeve on the left hand. Then, as you pull your opponent towards you, and you place your left leg in between your opponents legs. After that, you lift your right leg(you'll stand on your left leg), and you twist your upper-body at the same time to throw your opponent.</p>

<h2>Tsuri-Goshi</h2>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<p>Thru your exprerience of judo, you'll encounter people that will usually bend over a little bit to keep them-selves less exposed. Overall, it is still a major mistake jodokas do, because from there you can easely grab their belt, or find a momentum to throw them without even noticing.</p>
<br>
<p>Tsuri-Goshi is a easy technique that requires the force of pulling and the positioning of your hips. It is used in situations where your opponent is less taller than you. </p>
<br>
<p>To beggin, when you notice that your parter is in a lower position, grab their higher lapel(on the neck) or their belt with the hand that used to hold your opponents sleeve. When you got the right grip, you step accross your opponents legs, you pull and then you lift.</p>

<h2>Ippon-Seoi-Nage</h2>
<br><br>
<p>Ippon-Seoi-Nage is another classic judo technique which could be used in different ways. Usually, if you're right-handed, you would hold the lapel on your right hand. This technique is different because you hold the lapel on your left hand.</p>
<br>
<p>As you hold your lapel, you will have to turn to face the other side. Your right arm will go under your opponents arm on the side of the lapel you're holding, and make sure to not put your shoulder under, but the part which is your bicep. This way it makes your throw tight, and not loose. As you enter with you legs, you have to bend your knees a little bit to make sure that you entered well. At the end, your back is supposed to face the opponent, and it needs to have small space between your back and the opponent. When you throw, you have to pull the lapel, your arm will point the way you want to throw, and as you throw you straighten up your knees a little bit to give a push to your-self.</p>

<h2>Tai-Otoshi(Body Drop)</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>Tai-Otoshi is a very basic throw that requires less body contact. It requires timing, because the "Body Drop" term means that the person executing the throw has to break uke's balance over their streched leg.<p>
	<p>As said, it requires less body contact, but it requires footwork, the force of your lifting hand and hip power. To start, make sure you have a good grip, and that the uke is pushing you. That will help the throw. You have to the position your feet, so that you face the same way with your uke. Try to stand a little to his side, as you add in the power of your hip and hand to lift the uke and make him trip.</p>
