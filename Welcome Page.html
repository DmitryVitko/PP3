<h2>What is Judo?</h2>

<img id="img1", src="Jigoro.jpeg">
<p>Judo originates from the Japanese language, witch means "The gentle way". It is counted as a lot of thing for many different people. For some people it is a sport, for some it can be art or even a way of life!</p>
<br>
<p>Judo was founded in 1882 in Japan by Jigoro Kano. He modified dangerous techniques from jiu-jitsu, and developped Judo into a sport. He also gave Judo a physical education emphasis and a strong moral orientation. It is now the 2nd most practiced sport in the world.

<h3>About</h3>
<p> This website was made by a student passionate by martial arts. He started judo in 2021, and continued to do a project about this sport in 2023. This project is with an IB programm that helps students aim for a better future, by helping them learn and manage subjects on their own!</p>
<p> I will be happy doing this website, because my goal was to learn coding. I hope that I can explain well my experience with Judo thru this Website!)))</p>
