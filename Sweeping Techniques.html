<h1>Sweeping Techniques</h1>
<br>
<br>

<p>Footsweeps are an amazing way to surprise an opponent, because it's hard to see it coming. Footsweeps are timing based . Generally, after many tries, you will find a combination that will help you win a competition.

<h2><ins>Important Note<ins></h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>It is important not to kick your opponents body, you have to be careful. The right way to sweep is with the palm of your feet.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Osoto-Gari (Major Outer Reaping)</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>This technique is easy to memorise, and is beneficial to immediately drop your opponent on his back.</p>
<p>By finding momentum, you will have to place yourself on the right side of your opponent(if you are right handed). Unbalance your opponent on his right leg by pulling his to your chest, and as you do it, do your step with your left leg, the right leg goes up, and sweeps the leg that the opponent is standing on.</p>

<h2>Osoto-Otoshi(Larger Outer Drop)</h2>
<br><br>
<p>This technique is similar to Osoto-Gari, but instead of lifting your leg and sweeping, you have to put it on the ground between the opponents legs, and push him down with your upper body grip. This is an other way to easely pin down your oppenent, you just need to really work your upper body. When you're ready to pin him down, make sure to also add a slight twist.

<h2>Kosoto-Gake(Small Outside Hook)</h2>
<br><br>

<h2>Ouchi-Gari(Major Inner Reaping)</h2>
<br><br>
<p>
	To make this technique work, you have to pull your opponent for him to move his leg towards you. When you feel that he lifted his leg, sweep it, and pull his shoulders down to the floor.

<h2>Ko Uchi Gari(Minor Inner Reaping)</h2>
<br><br>
<p>Like any other techniques, you pull you opponent to yourself. As you detect his leg move towards you, sweep the heel to yourself.</p>
<p>It is important to pull his elbow toward the lower part of your chest. After many repetitions you should do this technique very smoothly, that leaves an amazing satisfaction every-time you'll do it right.</p>

<h2>De Ashi Harai(Forward Footsweep)</h2>
<br><br>
<p>This technique can only work if you catch your opponent lifting up his foot. You have to catch it right before the foot is place on the ground, or when it just got lifted up.</p>
<p>To ease up the sweeping, lift up your opponent with your arms before sweeping.</p>
